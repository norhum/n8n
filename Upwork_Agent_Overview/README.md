# Job Application Automation with n8n

This project shows how I used **n8n** to automate key aspects of the job application process. The automation includes tasks like generating personalized application letters, creating professional project proposals, and visualizing the workflows with **Mermaid** diagrams. By integrating **Google Docs**, **Google Drive**, and **powerful language models** like **Google Gemini**, I made these processes faster and more efficient.

The workflows created are reusable and can be easily customized for different job applications and project proposals, making the process simpler and saving valuable time.
